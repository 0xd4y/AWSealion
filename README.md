# Description
AWSealion is a CLI tool designed for pentesters and security enthusiasts to use in both professional settings and during CTFs. This tool helps in staying stealthy during red team and pentesting engagements to ensure that your attacking footprint is as small as possible in an AWS environment. This is done through not allowing the same API call to be run twice, allowing user-agent customization in a per-engagement and per-profile basis, and saving the output of all API calls. Furthermore, the AWSealion tool creates an organized file structure which the user can easily reference.
